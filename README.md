# Ferrous
Chess engine which plays in a local environment

### History
I ([Sava2008](https://github.com/Sava2008)) am a late intermediate chess player, and I have always admired how a machine can play better than any human being. I've been considering the idea of making my own engine for a few months now. I decided that I had enough competence to fullfil the dream, so, I embarked on building Ferrous, a functional chess engine that comes up with a move in any position by simply evaluating the material, and piece positioning.

### How to use
Open the terminal, either switch to the directory by typing `cd C:\wherever\you\unpacked\the\zip\file && cargo run -q`, or `cd C:\wherever\you\unpacked\the\zip\file && cargo run --release` and move the .exe file into the main directory, so that you can use it.
