### History
I ([Sava2008](https://github.com/Sava2008)) am a late intermediate chess player, and I have always admired how a machine can play better than any human being. I've been considering the idea of making my own engine for a few months now. I decided that I had enough competence to fullfil the dream, so, I embarked on building Ferrous, a functional chess engine that comes up with a move in any position by simply evaluating the material, and piece positioning.
